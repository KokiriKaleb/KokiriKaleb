🛠️ My Tech Stack
🚀 Featured Project: OKCupid Age Predictor
This is a complete, end-to-end data science project that demonstrates my ability to handle a complex, real-world dataset and deliver a functional product.



The final model's feature importance chart, confirming that life-stage indicators are the strongest predictors of age.

Goal: To predict a user's age based on their profile information, including demographics, lifestyle choices, and free-form essays.

Process:

EDA & Cleaning: Performed extensive exploratory data analysis and cleaned a dataset of ~60,000 user profiles.

Feature Engineering: Engineered over 1000 features from categorical, datetime, multi-label, and unstructured text data (using TF-IDF).

Modeling: Compared Ridge Regression and Random Forest models, concluding that the simpler, regularized Ridge model performed best (MAE: ~4.8 years, R²: 0.52).

Deployment: Deployed the final model as an interactive web application using Flask and Render.
