### 🚀 Featured Project: OKCupid Age Predictor
This is a complete, end-to-end data science project that demonstrates my ability to handle a complex, real-world dataset and deliver a functional product.

**Goal**: To predict a user's age based on their profile information, including demographics, lifestyle choices, and free-form essays.

**Process**:
1.  **EDA & Cleaning**: Performed extensive exploratory data analysis and cleaned a dataset of ~60,000 user profiles.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: Engineered over 1000 features from categorical, datetime, multi-label, and unstructured text data (using TF-IDF).
3.  **Modeling**: Compared Ridge Regression and Random Forest models, concluding that the simpler, regularized Ridge model performed best (MAE: ~4.8 years, R²: 0.52).
4.  **Deployment**: Deployed the final model as an interactive web application using Flask and Render.
